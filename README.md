# start-with-react

--Starting with React--


This project's package.json includes all libraries
and resources for getting a React project running.

After your workspace is created, go to a 
terminal and change into the "demo-1" directory.  
Then run: 
>npm install 

 to download and configure
all of the resources and initialize your
new React project.

After npm install has completed, 
from the terminal (in the demo-1 directory) you can 
run the project with the command:
>npm run dev

When the compilation completes, open a browser: 
> localhost:3000
